About:
A front-end heavy artist portfolio page with an accompanying backend API to fetch the data securely.

Constraints:
For this project, the client needed a slightly secure, simple portfolio site to log in to. The content should be hidden away until you log into the application.
The client did not have a backend and the files were stored on their server.

Solution:
-As to not give any space on my database servers, I created an API, stored it on a server I had allocated for customers with small traffic websites who need a backend, and saved the password there. 
-The dynamic html is created separately. The root element and tree are stored and fetched from the same API.
